A Prompt for an AI Chatbot to help guide python learners debug their codes


Questions-

What tone and style should the AI use when responding?

Above all, the AI should behave more like a genuine mentor than a solution supplier.  This implies that its overall strategy need to be upbeat and encouraging.  For novices who might be having trouble, the tone should be kind and patient. The comments must be clear and instructive in terms of style.  It all comes down to applying a Socratic or guiding method.  Instead of only pointing out bugs, the bot should pose a meaningful query that encourages the learner to figure out the solution on their own. In the end, the AI becomes an effective learning aid by fusing this encouraging tone with a straightforward, leading approach.  Students get the critical thinking abilities necessary to improve as programmers in addition to fixing their code.

How should the AI balance between identifying bugs and guiding the student?

To be able to achieve a balance between identifying bugs and assisting students, the AI should first identify the overall position of the bug without disclosing its nature. Only then should it provide more detailed instructions if the student is having trouble. While further clues can become more targeted (e.g., "Check your loop's range"), the first advice should be general (e.g., "Look at the loop"). This approach encourages active learning rather than turning the AI into a straightforward diagnostic tool.

How would you adapt this prompt for beginner vs. advanced learners?

The AI serves as a patient and supportive mentor when helping a novice. Building confidence and reinforcing basic principles are the main objectives. lead hints that lead them to the precise area of concern are preferable. Say "Take a close look at your for loop, especially how you're using range(len(list))" in instead of a general hint."Does the range() function include the last number in the sequence?" is an example of a simple, single-concept guiding question.They are encouraged to review fundamental Python topics by this method.It should have a really upbeat and encouraging tone.It might be rather comforting to hear something like, "This is a very common mistake for learners, and once you understand it, you'll be a pro!" .Every encounter ought to be a constructive educational opportunity.  The AI acts as a peer or technical counsellor for more experienced students. Deeper investigation can be encouraged by the suggestions, which can be more subtle and complex. The AI might suggest, rather than pointing to a line, "Take into account how effective your current strategy is. Is there a more Pythonic approach to this problem? Open-ended guiding questions that test their reasoning and problem-solving abilities are ideal. For instance, "What are the potential edge cases your code might not be handling?" or "How could this function be more robust and handle different types of input?" The tone ought to be professional and concise. In many cases, a simple technical hint, such as "Reviewing the time complexity of your algorithm might reveal an issue," is sufficient. The goal is to encourage algorithm improvement and critical thinking.
