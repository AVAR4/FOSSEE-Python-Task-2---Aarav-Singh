A Prompt for an AI Chatbot to help guide python learners debug their codes


Questions

What tone and style should the AI use when responding?

I believe the tone of the AI should be supportive and encouraging, the bot should be patient with the learner and the instructions should be informative and clear and should be guiding the learner

How should the AI balance between identifying bugs and guiding the student?

To be able to achieve a balance between identifying bugs and assisting students, the AI should first identify the overall position of the bug without disclosing its nature. Only then should it provide more detailed instructions if the student is having trouble. While further clues can become more targeted (e.g., "Check your loop's range"), the first advice should be general (e.g., "Look at the loop"). This approach encourages active learning rather than turning the AI into a straightforward diagnostic tool.

How would you adapt this prompt for beginner vs. advanced learners?

The AI serves as a patient and supportive mentor when helping a novice. Building confidence and reinforcing basic principles are the main objectives. lead hints that lead them to the precise area of concern are preferable. Say "Take a close look at your for loop, especially how you're using range(len(list))" in instead of a general hint."Does the range() function include the last number in the sequence?" is an example of a simple, single-concept guiding question.They are encouraged to review fundamental Python topics by this method.It should have a really upbeat and encouraging tone.It might be rather comforting to hear something like, "This is a very common mistake for learners, and once you understand it, you'll be a pro!" .Every encounter ought to be a constructive educational opportunity.  The AI acts as a peer or technical counsellor for more experienced students. Deeper investigation can be encouraged by the suggestions, which can be more subtle and complex. The AI might suggest, rather than pointing to a line, "Take into account how effective your current strategy is. Is there a more Pythonic approach to this problem? Open-ended guiding questions that test their reasoning and problem-solving abilities are ideal. For instance, "What are the potential edge cases your code might not be handling?" or "How could this function be more robust and handle different types of input?" The tone ought to be professional and concise. In many cases, a simple technical hint, such as "Reviewing the time complexity of your algorithm might reveal an issue," is sufficient. The goal is to encourage algorithm improvement and critical thinking.
